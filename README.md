With `dummy-blockchain` you can get a feel on how the peer-to-peer Bitcoin protocol works by launching and interacting with multiple independent nodes.

A node can do the following:

- include a new transaction to its pending pool of transactions
- include its pending transactions to a new block by "mining" a new block that will be appended to the node's chain
- add a node to its list of known nodes
- check if a node from its list of know nodes has a longer chain and, if that's the case, replace its current chain by the longest one found
- check the validity of its chain

A node offers a user-friendly http interface and a REST api. Once the node is started, the http interface can be accessed at `localhost:8080`. This is also the root url for the REST api calls.

All the data are kept in-memory and destroyed once the node is shut down.

## Source code structure

```
blockchain/ <- the interesting stuff
docs/       <- some screenshots
gui/        <- the http frontend and REST handlers
mod.go      <- the http server setup and entrypoint
```

## Run

Each node is an http server. You can run as many as you want. The arguments are optional.

You can either build and run a node from source, or use one of the realease,
which are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows (check the release section of
the repo).

Build and run from source:

```bash
# Build and run a node on http://localhost:8081
go run mod.go -listen-addr :8081 -owner Alice
```

Run from the release:

```bash
# Run a node on a Mac, using http://localhost:8081
./dummyblockchain.darwin-amd64 -listen-addr :8081 -owner Alice
```

The owner indicates who the transaction fees earned by the node will be sent to.

## REST API

**Get the chain**

```bash
GET /get_chain
```

**Mine a block**

```bash
GET /mine_block
```

**Check and replace chain if needed**

```bash
GET /replace_chain
```

**Check the chain validity**

```bash
GET /is_valid
```

**Add a node**

```bash
POST /add_node

# body application/json 
{
    "Nodes": [
        {
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 8081
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Add a transaction**

```bash
POST /add_transaction

# Body application/json
{
    "Sender": "Alice",
    "Receiver": "Bob",
    "Amount": 10
}
```
